Water Tank Control System with Cat &amp; Dog Detection

Project Topic: Automated Pet Feeding and Water Tank Control System

Description:
This project implements an automated pet feeding and water tank control system. It utilizes an Arduino board to control motors, servos, and pumps based on signals received from a serial communication. The system not only detects the presence of cats using image processing techniques but also provides food to both cats and dogs based on their specific feeding schedules. Additionally, it monitors the water tank level and ensures a continuous supply of fresh water for the pets.

Key Features:

    Cat and dog detection using image processing techniques
    Automated feeding of cats and dogs based on individual schedules
    Water pump activation for continuous water supply
    Motor control for specific movements
    Servo control for precise positioning
    GUI application to monitor and manage feeding schedules and water tank level

Hardware Requirements:

    Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
    Motor drivers
    Servo motors
    Water pump
    Webcam or camera module
    Pet food dispensers
    Water level sensor

Software Requirements:

    Arduino IDE
    OpenCV (for image processing)
    Python (for the GUI application)

Installation and Usage:

    Detailed installation and setup instructions are provided in the repository.
    The repository includes the necessary code, circuit diagram, and documentation.
    Follow the instructions to set up the hardware and software components.
    Use the GUI application to manage feeding schedules, monitor the water tank level, and observe pet detection and system actions.
